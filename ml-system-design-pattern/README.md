# Machine learning system design pattern
This repository contains system design patterns for training, serving and operation of machine learning systems in production.

## Objectives
The main objective of this document is to explain system patterns for designing machine learning system in production. <br>
This document is not the design patterns for developing machine learning model to achieve certain performance in accuracy, though some columns may refer to those use-cases.
<br>

## Prerequisites
All of the ML system patterns are designed to be deployed on a public cloud or a Kubernetes cluster. The document tries not to be dependent on a certain programming language or platform as possible, though since Python is the most major language for the machine learning technology, most of the patterns can be developed with Python.
